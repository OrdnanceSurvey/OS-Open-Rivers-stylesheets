# OS Open Rivers

These are **QML** files for OS Open Rivers in **Shapefile** format for use in **QGIS**.

*They have been designed to work with the data as it is supplied.*

## Quick start guide

**1.**  Fork or [download](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OS-Open-Rivers-stylesheets/archive/master.zip) the contents of this repository

**2.**  Copy the folder ‘ordnance_survey’ into your QGIS SVG directory (a typical Windows file path is C:\Program Files\QGIS xxxx\apps\qgis\svg, where xxxx represents whatever version of QGIS you are running).

*Your machine may require a restart for QGIS to recognise the new SVGs*

**3.**  Load your OS Open Rivers shapefile data into QGIS

**4.**  Double click on a layer to access the 'Layer Properties' window > click on 'Load Style...' > navigate to the directory containing the QML files (those ending .qml) > select the QML file that corresponds to that layer > click 'Open' > click 'OK'

*Repeat step 4 for all layers*

**6.**  We recommend the following layer order and visibility:

We recommend viewing the map between **1:1,000** and **1:200,000** for maximum legibility

Your map should now look similar to this:
