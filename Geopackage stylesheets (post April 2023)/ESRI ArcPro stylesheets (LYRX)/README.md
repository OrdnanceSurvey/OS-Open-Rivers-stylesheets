# OS Open Rivers

These are **LYRX** files for OS Open Rivers in **Geopackage** format for use in **ESRI ArcPro**.

*They have been designed to work with the data as it is supplied and have been designed to work with the geopackage data downloaded from the OS DataHub **after April 2023.***


## Quick start guide

**1.**  Fork or [download](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OS-Open-Rivers-stylesheets/archive/master.zip) the contents of this repository

**2.**  Open a new blank map in ArcPro. Right-click on ‘Map’ at the top of the Table Of Contents, select Properties… > then under the Coordinate System tab > choose British National Grid.

**6.** Double-click on a layer to access the Layer 'Properties' window > select the 'Source' tab > clcik on 'Set Data Source...' > navigate to your OS Open Rivers data > select the data that matches the layer > select 'Add'

We recommend viewing the map between **1:1,000** and **1:200,000** for maximum legibility

Your map should now look similar to this:
